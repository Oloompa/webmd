From markdown to website.

## Goal

I need a static site generator for my next website. I needed also to experiment [Deno](https://deno.land/).

## Development

All useful commands for project are inside a makefile. To list them you can type `make help` or just `make`.

You need [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) in order to lint your commit message automatically.
